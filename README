DESCRIPTION:
------------

This is version 0.1 of DBD-Pg.
DBD-Pg is a PostgreSQL interface for Perl 5 using DBI.

For further information about DBI look at:
      http://www.fugue.com/dbi/


IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:
---------------------

Please send comments and bug-reports to <E.Mergl@bawue.de>

Please include the output of perl -v,
                         and perl -V,
           the version of PostgreSQL,
           the version of DBD-Pg,
           and the version of DBI
in your bug-report.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

  - build, test and install Perl 5         (at least 5.003)
  - build, test and install the DBI module (at least 0.71)
  - build, test and install PostgreSQL     (at least 6.0)


PLATFORMS:
----------

  This release of DBD-Pg has been developed using Linux 2.0 with 
  dynamic loading for the perl extensions. Let me know, if there 
  are any problems with other platforms.


INSTALLATION:
-------------

The Makefile checks the environment variable POSTGRESHOME as well 
some standard locations, to find the root directory of your Postgres 
installation.
 
1.   perl Makefile.PL
2.   make
3.   make test
4.   make install

( 1. to 3. as normal user, not as root ! )


TESTING:
--------

Run 'make test'.
Note, that the user running this script must have been created with
the access rights to create databases *AND* users ! Do not run this
script as root !

If you are using the shared library libpq.so, make sure, your dynamic 
loader is able to find libpq.so. With Linux the command /sbin/ldconfig -v 
should tell you, where it finds libpq.so. If not, you need to add an 
appropriate entry to /etc/ld.so.conf or to the environment variable 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Some linux distributions (eg slackware) have an incomplete perl installation.
If you have compile errors like "XS_VERSION_BOOTCHECK undeclared", make a
          'find /usr/lib/perl5 -name XSUB.h -print'
If this file is not present, you need to recompile and reinstall perl.
