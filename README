IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:
---------------------

Please send comments and bug-reports to <dbi-users@fugue.com>>

Please include the output of perl -v,
                         and perl -V,
           the version of PostgreSQL,
           the version of DBD-Pg,
           and the version of DBI
in your bug-report.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

  - build, test and install Perl 5         (at least 5.003)
  - build, test and install the DBI module (at least 1.00)
  - build, test and install PostgreSQL     (at least 6.5)


PLATFORMS:
----------

  This release of DBD-Pg has been developed using Linux 2.2 with 
  dynamic loading for the perl extensions. Let me know, if there 
  are any problems with other platforms.


INSTALLATION:
-------------

The Makefile checks the environment variables POSTGRES_INCLUDE and 
POSTGRES_LIB, to find the library libpq.so and the include file libpq-fe.h. 
 
If you are not sure about setting the two environment variables 
POSTGRES_INCLUDE and POSTGRES_LIB, do the following:
first try to find the files libpq-fe.h and libpq.so. If 
available on your system use the locate command. Then set 
POSTGRES_INCLUDE to the directory where you found libpq-fe.h
and set POSTGRES_LIB to the directory where you found libpq.so.

1.   perl Makefile.PL
2.   make
3.   make test
4.   make install

( 1. to 3. as normal user, not as root ! )


TESTING:
--------

Run 'make test'.
Note, that the user running this script must have been created with
the access rights to create databases *AND* users ! Do not run this
script as root !

If you need to run the test against a remote server, set the environment
variables PGHOST and PGPORT. 

If testing fails with the message 'login failed', please check if access 
to the database template1 as well as pgperltest is not protected in pg_hba.conf. 

If you are using the shared library libpq.so check if your dynamic loader 
finds libpq.so. With Linux the command /sbin/ldconfig -v should tell you, 
where it finds libpq.so. If ldconfig does not find libpq.so, either add an 
appropriate entry to /etc/ld.so.conf and re-run ldconfig or add the path to 
the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
A typical error message resulting from not finding libpq.so is: 
  install_driver(Pg) failed: Can't load './blib/arch/auto/DBD/Pg/Pg.so' 
  for module DBD::Pg: File not found at 

Some linux distributions have an incomplete perl installation.
If you have compile errors like "XS_VERSION_BOOTCHECK undeclared", make a
          'find .../lib/perl5 -name XSUB.h -print'
If this file is not present, you need to recompile and reinstall perl.

SGI users: if you get segmentation faults make sure, you use the malloc which 
           comes with perl when compiling perl (the default is not to).
           "David R. Noble" <drnoble@engsci.sandia.gov>

HP users: if you get error messages like:
              can't open shared library: .../lib/libpq.sl
              No such file or directory
          when running the test script, try to replace the 
          'shared' option in the LDDFLAGS with 'archive'.
          Dan Lauterbach <danla@dimensional.com>

FreeBSD users: if you get during make test the error message:
    'DBD driver has not implemented the AutoCommit attribute'
    recompile the DBI module and the DBD-Pg module and disable
    optimization. This error message is due to the broken
    optimization in gcc-2.7.2.1.

Sun Users: if you get compile errors like:
           /usr/include/string.h:57: parse error before `]'
           then you need to remove from pgsql/include/libpq-fe.h
           the define for strerror, which clashes with the definition
           in the standard include file.
