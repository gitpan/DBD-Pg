DESCRIPTION:
------------

This is version 0.97 of DBD-Pg.
DBD-Pg is a PostgreSQL interface for Perl5 using DBI.

For further information about DBI look at:

      http://www.isc.org/services/public/lists/dbi-lists.html


RECENT CHANGES:
---------------

- fix bug in connect method, which erroneously set the userid
  and the password to the environment variables DBI_USER and
  DBI_PASS.
- applied patch from Jan-Pieter Cornet <john@pc.xs4all.nl>,
  which removed the special handling of a backslash when
  used for octal presentation. Now a backslash always will
  be escaped.

IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:
---------------------

Please send comments and bug-reports to <dbi-users@fugue.com>>

Please include the output of perl -v,
                         and perl -V,
           the version of PostgreSQL,
           the version of DBD-Pg,
           and the version of DBI
in your bug-report.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

  - build, test and install Perl 5         (at least 5.003)
  - build, test and install the DBI module (at least 1.00)
  - build, test and install PostgreSQL     (at least 6.5)


PLATFORMS:
----------

  This release of DBD-Pg has been developed using Linux 2.2 with 
  dynamic loading for the perl extensions. Let me know, if there 
  are any problems with other platforms.


INSTALLATION:
-------------

The Makefile checks the environment variables POSTGRES_INCLUDE and
POSTGRES_LIB, to find the library libpq.so and the proper include files. 
 
1.   perl Makefile.PL
2.   make
3.   make test
4.   make install

( 1. to 3. as normal user, not as root ! )

For Windows-NT use the pre-compiled package DBD-Pg.zip. 
Unzip the package and follow the instructions in the 
README. 


TESTING:
--------

Run 'make test'.
Note, that the user running this script must have been created with
the access rights to create databases *AND* users ! Do not run this
script as root !

If testing fails with the message 'login failed', please check if access 
to the database template1 as well as pgperltest is not protected in pg_hba.conf. 

If you are using the shared library libpq.so check if your dynamic loader 
finds libpq.so. With Linux the command /sbin/ldconfig -v should tell you, 
where it finds libpq.so. If ldconfig does not find libpq.so, either add an 
appropriate entry to /etc/ld.so.conf and re-run ldconfig or add the path to 
the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
A typical error message resulting from not finding libpq.so is: 
  install_driver(Pg) failed: Can't load './blib/arch/auto/DBD/Pg/Pg.so' 
  for module DBD::Pg: File not found at 

If you get an error message like:
  perl: error while loading shared libraries:
  /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/i386-linux/auto/DBD/Pg/Pg.so: undefined
  symbol: PQconnectdb
when you call DBI->connect, then your libpq.so was probably not seen at
build-time. This should have caused 'make test' to fail; did you really
run it and look at the output? Check the setting of POSTGRES_LIB and
recompile DBD-Pg.
 
 Some linux distributions have an incomplete perl installation.
If you have compile errors like "XS_VERSION_BOOTCHECK undeclared", make a
          'find .../lib/perl5 -name XSUB.h -print'
If this file is not present, you need to recompile and reinstall perl.

SGI users: if you get segmentation faults make sure, you use the malloc which 
           comes with perl when compiling perl (the default is not to).
           "David R. Noble" <drnoble@engsci.sandia.gov>

HP users: if you get error messages like:
              can't open shared library: .../lib/libpq.sl
              No such file or directory
          when running the test script, try to replace the 
          'shared' option in the LDDFLAGS with 'archive'.
          Dan Lauterbach <danla@dimensional.com>

FreeBSD users: if you get during make test the error message:
    'DBD driver has not implemented the AutoCommit attribute'
    recompile the DBI module and the DBD-Pg module and disable
    optimization. This error message is due to the broken
    optimization in gcc-2.7.2.1.

Sun Users: if you get compile errors like:
           /usr/include/string.h:57: parse error before `]'
           then you need to remove from pgsql/include/libpq-fe.h
           the define for strerror, which clashes with the definition
           in the standard include file.


Win32 Users: Running DBD-Pg scripts on Win32 needs some configuration work
             on the server side:
             - add a postgres user with the same name as the NT-User (eg Administrator)
             - make sure, that your pg_hba.conf on the server is configured, 
               such that a connection from another host will be accepted
