The pg_type subdirectory contains a utility module to convert the numeric 
output of $sth->{'TYPE'} into literal type names. This can be done in two 
ways: either using an appropriate select or by looking into the appropriate 
include file and providing an array for all types. Because the first method 
is quite expensive we choose the second method. The module pg_type.pm 
contains only this array and can be used to convert the numeric output from 
$sth->{'TYPE'} - which is based on the libpq function PQftype() - into type 
names. Because the numeric type OIDs are likely to change with a new version 
of PostgreSQL, the script pg_type.pl is provided. It just greps through the 
include file and builds pg_type.pm. It should be run whenever a new PostgreSQL 
version is installed.
