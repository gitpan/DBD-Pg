TODO: 

- Mention RETURNING clause support in docs.
- Play nicely with standard_conforming_strings (CPAN bug #27538)
- Use WITH HOLD for cursor work
- Start testing with a thread-enabled Perl
- Create a .ppm for Windows
- Change quote and dequote functions to take Sv instead of string so that
   things like arrays can be serialized by the quote function.  This will
   take care of broken chopblanks and pg_bool_tf (pass the quote/dequote 
   options struct to function quote/dequote functions).
- Allow user callbacks to quote user-defined types?
- Move to the Module::Build system
- Remove libpq dependency
- Handle and/or better tests for different encoding, especially those not 
   supported as a server encoding (e.g. BIG5)
- Make a CPAN bundle
