TODO: 

- Support for new error protocol
- Support new DBI trace scheme.
- Create a .ppm for Windows
- Change quote and dequote functions to take Sv instead of string so that
   things like arrays can be serialized by the quote function.  This will
   take care of broken chopblanks and pg_bool_tf (pass the  quote/dequote 
   options struct to function quote/dequote functions).
- Implement a clean UTF-8 support.
- Add array OID types
- Quoting/dequoting of arrays.
- Allow user callbacks to quote user-defined types?
- Rename functions and add defines to avoid problems with static linking of multi DBDs
- Move to the Module::Build system
