	- Maintenance transferred to GBorg,
        http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/dbdpg/projdisplay.php. Incremented
        version number to reflect new management. [Bruce Momjian]

        is working. [Thomas Lowery]

        primary_key_info(). [Thomas Lowery]

        Lippan]
	- Removed redundant use of strlen() in pg_error() (Jason E. Stewart).

        rather than files. Contributed by Garth Webb.

	bind_param() and documented the correct approach: "bind_param($num,

	Wheeler]
